## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    IP addresses are addresses that specify what embedded device is connected to the Internet.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    DNS, or Domain Name Service, is a linkage between a symbolic name and its corresponding IP address.
Benefits of using DNS compared to an IP address is that it has a symbolic name which is easier to write out for the user than an IP address.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP addresses do not change when being used, dynamic IP address change over time as it is connected to a device.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP is fast, but not reliable while TCP is reliable, but not fast.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

     We cant use the delay function with Blynk because it will mess up the timing and break it since Blynk is event based.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    A fuction to be "Blocking" would mean that nothing else is funning, which would waste time to be spent elsewhere.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts are effective for writing Non-Blocking code because it will run immediately, regardless of what program of code is running.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines how a function is called vs implementation is what the function does. This is important to understanding how a program and a user communicate.
